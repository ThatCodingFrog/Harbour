# What is this?
This is a in-progress library + launcher for games made by HarbourMasters, built with Dear ImGui.  Its purpose is similar to Steam to make it easier for gamers to set up and play Ship of Harkinian, 2Ship, and more. It also could support mods that would be too complex to merge upstream.

# How do I set it up?
All you have to do is download the executable for your operating system. From there, you can automatically download, update, and launch your favorite HarbourMasters' games.

# Planned/potential includes:
- SpaghettiKart (once it is officially released)
- Ocarina of Time x Majora's Mask Randomizer
- Romhack Support
